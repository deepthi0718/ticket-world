## Overview
**Ticket World** is an interactive, front-end web application built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It simulates a dynamic ticketing platform where users can explore various categories—such as concerts, sports, stand-up shows, movies, or events—and select seats to proceed with booking. The interface is designed to be visually engaging and user-friendly, making it ideal for demonstrating UI/UX design and DOM manipulation skills.

Main components of the system include:  
1. **Category Navigation:** Users can browse different ticket types like concerts, sports, stand-up comedy, movies, and more.  
2. **Dynamic Seat Selection:** Interactive seat layouts for each event that allow users to select or deselect seats.  
3. **Modular Pages:** Separate HTML files for each ticket type (e.g., `ticket-concert.html`, `ticket-sports.html`) to maintain clear organization.  
4. **Responsive UI Styling:** Tailored CSS styling for each event page to enhance the visual experience.
